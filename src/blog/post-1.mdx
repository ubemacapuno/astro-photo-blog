### How I use Cloudinary for my photos - and the issues I ran into

Cloudinary is a popular image-hosting site that I decided to use for my photos. For my current workflow, I upload my photos to Cloudinary, then grab the URLs from Cloudinary and reference them on my pages and blogs throughout this site.

<br />

The reason I made this formatter is because it's kind of a pain to copy a single URL off Cloudinary, paste it into my markdown file, then manually add the transformations and add `[](url)`, add `<br />` tags, etc. I intend to paste several images in a row, so I made this tool to help me out. With this tool, I can just copy and paste a bunch of URLs, and it will generate the markdown for me, with the transformations and `<br />` tags already added.

<br />

**Example of raw Cloudinary URLs:**

```

```

<br />
**Why Cloudinary instead of dropping everything within this app in the `public/`
folder?**{" "}

<br />

I didn't want to bloat the repo with big assets, and I wanted a CDN so images
load fast everywhere. Plus Cloudinary can resize and re-encode on the fly. One upload,
many sizes and formats without me doing the work.

<br />

I plan to build out an image component in the future, in which case I could probably just paste in the URLs and have the parser logic in that component, but for now, I'm okay just pasting markdown images with `<br />` tags.

<br />

For transformations, I use `f_auto` (best format per browser), `q_auto` (auto quality), `w_1200` (max width), and `c_limit` (scale down, never up). That means smaller payloads, better layout control, and no manual resizing!

<br />

The parser is pretty dumb but gets the job done. I'm essentially just splitting the input on newlines, then applying the transformations to each line, and then joining the lines back together. You can see the Vue component code [here](https://github.com/ubemacapuno/astro-photo-blog/blob/main/src/components/vue/CloudinaryFormatter.vue). I used [refs](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs) to store the input and output, and a boolean to track if any lines were skipped.

<br />

Anyways, I hope to write more posts like this in the future. Maybe the next one will be about the image component . . . until next time!
