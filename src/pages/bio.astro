      I'm a Phoenix-based photographer and software developer. I was
      inspired to try film photography by a friend in fall 2024 during a
      rock climbing trip to Priest Draw, Arizona. Having to slow down and think
      through each shot was a refreshing shift from the speed of digital
      photography. I'm currently focused on shooting film, but I'll also
      be sharing digital photography from time to time.

      With a couple of used Pentax film cameras I found on eBay, I've
      learned to slow things down and appreciate the craft of operating
      completely manual cameras. I found a thrill in having limited shots
      to strive for the perfect frame.

      to explore web technologies like Astro and Vue.js while
      combining my passions for software development and photography. I
      also wanted to share my photography the way I want, without having
      to crop, force aspect ratios, and overly compress my photos (looking
      at you, Instagram!!).

      When I'm not behind the camera or screen, you'll find me climbing
      crags around Arizona, hiking throughout the Phoenix valleys, or
      tinkering with personal projects. Originally from Michigan, I've
      called Phoenix home since 2018.
