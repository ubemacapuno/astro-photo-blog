      I’m a Phoenix-based photographer and software developer. During a climbing
      trip to Priest Draw in October 2024, a friend brought along his Canon
      AE-1. I was still shooting digital, but it inspired me to try film myself.
      Soon after, I bought an old Pentax ME and started shooting film. The
      slower pace and limited frames forced me to be more intentional with each
      shot. I was hooked, and I’ve focused on film since.

      more recently in 2022 during the pandemic.

      When I'm not behind the camera or computer screen, you'll find me at
      climbing gyms or crags around Arizona, hiking throughout the Phoenix
      valleys, or tinkering with personal projects. Originally from Michigan,
      I've called Phoenix home since 2018.
