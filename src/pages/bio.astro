      I’m a photographer and software developer based in Phoenix, Arizona.
      During a climbing trip to Priest Draw in October 2024, a friend brought
      along his Canon AE-1. I was still shooting digital, but it inspired me to

      shooting film. The slower pace and limited frames forced me to be more
      intentional with each shot. I was hooked, and I’ve focused on film since.
