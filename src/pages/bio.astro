      I'm Corey, a Phoenix-based photographer and software developer. I was
      inspired to shoot film photos with a manual SLR by a friend in October
      2024 during a rock climbing trip in Priest Draw, Arizona. Having to slow
      down and think through each shot was a refreshing shift from the speed of
      digital photography. I'm currently focused on shooting film, but I'll also
      be sharing digital photography from time to time.

      been a photo enthusiast since circa 2009, software dev is a hobby I picked
      up more recently in 2022 during the pandemic.

      When I'm not behind the camera or computer screen, you'll find me at
      climbing gyms or crags around Arizona, hiking throughout the Phoenix
      valleys, or tinkering with personal projects. Originally from Michigan,
      I've called Phoenix home since 2018.
